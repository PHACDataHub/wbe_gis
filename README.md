This repo is designed to assist with the geolocation of patient data in a way that both respects patient  confidentiality and respects copyright.

This is accomplished by leaving the data on the computer of the owner of the data, while using encrypted versions of the PCCF file to aggregate data, by a given shape file.

Note: this software will not run without a copy the PCCF.
